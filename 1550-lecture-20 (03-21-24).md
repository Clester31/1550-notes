# Lecture 20

## Review

* Busy waiting - do non-important work while waiting for the work we want to do to open up

## Producer/Consumer Problem (Bounded Buffer problem)

* Highest Level - we can have threads/processes that we call producers whose jobs is to produce things that are consumed by other threads or processes called consumers
* Our rates for consumption or production may turn out different.
  * We can create more producer threads if the consumption is slower and vice versa
  * The producer and consumer can share a buffer (array) that both can access. it acts like a cache where the producers can produce from and consumers can consume from
  * our buffer has a fixed size, if our producer/consumer gets ahead of the other, we could either underrun or overrun our buffer
    * We want to have a count for the buffer that will let us know if there is something ready for consumption or production
    * We have a system call that will put the caller processor thread in the block state, we do this if the buffer is full in the producer, or if the buffer is 0 in the consumer
      * In this instance, we will call on sleep().
      * When do we wake up? we have a wakeup() call that acts on both the producer and consumer
      * When our producer makes something, wake up our consumer to consumer it (and vice versa)
* Issues - Race Conditions
  * we have a shared variable (counter), that could be changed incorrectly during a context switch
  * buffer[in/out]: another producer could steal the spot on the buffer
* Issues - consumer starts first
  * We will initially have nothing in our buffer (counter = 0), so there is nothing to consumer - therefore, go to sleep()
  * But what if between reading and sleeping we get preempted and go into producer
  * counter != N, so go through producer code and increase our counter to 1
  * Now we go wake up the consumer, but it's not asleep... what now?
    * We deadlock - both processes are blocked and waiting for the other to do something but they never will, no code will run
* Mutexing
  * put the entire inside of each function into one critical region. Might not be best for parallelism but good for performance
  * but we still could have a race condition
 
### Condition Variables

* A condition under which a thread executes or is blocked

* Wake up anyone that is waiting for a consumer/producer

* If we have our value set to -N, we have N processes asleep
  * Down represents a decrement (sleep)
  * Up represents a increment (up)
