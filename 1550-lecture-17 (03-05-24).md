## Other Scheduling Algorithms

* Shortest Process Next
  * SJF applied to interactive systems
  * What should a job be? Is this fair?
 
* Garunteed Scheduling
  * N processes get 1/N of the CPU time
  * More policy based
  * How do we implement this?
    * Mechanism: Sort jobs by accrued time. Take the lowest and schedule it
    * This means that I/O bound processes will usually be lower in the scheduling 
  * Is it fair?
    * We can have an instance where we have two processes A and B
      * If A (1/4) runs below its garuntee (1/2), we can run B (3/4) for a little longer as we have some extra time to do so
        * A is most likely IO bound while B is CPU bound
    * If we keep picking the lower garunteed processes, we will eventually get to a point where we run our CPU bound processes
      * The garuntees of our IO bound processes will get closer to 0 as we keep picking the lower ones

* Fair Share
  * N users get 1/N CPU time
 
* Lottery Scheduling
  * Give out tickets, pull one at random, winner runs
    * Seen in something like round robin
      * Processes with higher priority get more tickets
      * Our low priority processes will not be starved and will at least get a chance to run  
  * Mechanism based

### Mechanism vs Polocy

* Mechanism - the way in which something is done
* Policy - what we want to achieve
  * Example:
    * Policy: Library closes at 8PM
    * Mechanism: Armed gaurds force everyone out
   
### Real-time System Scheduling: Earliest Deadline First

* A **Real-time system** is one where we have work and deadlines which to do it by
* We further subdivide real-time systems based upon what happens if we don't meet the deadline
  * **Soft Real-time systems** - It's bad to miss a deadline (causes quality degradation, like decoding video/audio data of a DVD disk)
  * **Hard real-time system** - If you miss a deadline, you may as well have not even tried (self-driving cars autopilot, control systems for nuclear plants)
 
* How do we schedule with deadlines
  * If the workload is known ahead of time, does not change, and all deadlines are able to be met: **Earliest Deadline First**
  * It's like deadlines for class
    * Do the work that's due in two days first over the one due in two weeks
   
## Interprocess Communication (IPC) - These are on the new slides

### A queue with a race condition

* If we have two things doing computational work, they may want to communicate through some shared data structure (like a queue)
* Both of our processes will use enqueue() to put something into the queue
* We aren't worried about order, but having our values end up in the queue
