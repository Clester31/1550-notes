# Lecture 25

### Review from Lecture

* Problem: Managing memory
  * we have limited memory, which could be an issue if our process needs more memory then we have
    * We will always have more than one process in RAM
  * How did we solve this first?: Overlays
    * Hand-written dynamic loading of subsets of a programâ€™s code and data
    * The programmer will have to worry about the loading and unloading of every piece of code in data (in assembly)
    * Incredibly tedious, low level, difficult, and had to be done entirely by the programmer
   
### Virtual Addresses

* We use a table to do a mapping from a virtual address (the lie) to a physical address (the truth)
  * Issue: it takes us space (2^32 (4.2 billion) entrie) -> 16 GB to hold that table.
  * How do we make the number of entires smaller? Chunking
    * We call the part our entry represent (the chunk) a page
    * We can then have one entry per page
   
### MMU Algorithm
   
* Assume:
  4B -> VA
  4B -> PA
  4KB -> Page Size

* MMU Algorightm
----------------
  Input: VA
  Output: PA
  Steps: 0 <- (2000/4096) & (2004/4096)
  Page # <- VA / PageSize
  Offset <- VA % PageSize
  Frame # <- PageTable[Page #] <- we want this to live in RAM
  PA <- Frame # * Page Size + offset OR (Frame # <<12 | offset)
        (Starting PA of the frame)

1 x 4096 + 2000 = 6096
1 X 4096 + 2004 = 6100

* Everything in the page must move as a group into RAM
  * This means we will bring along things we did not want
* Work: It's all O(1)
  * But division and multiplication can be slow
  * We can make our page size a power of 2 so that we just have to bit shift to the right
 
* 32-bit VA (shitty diagram edition)

|    Page #    | offset |
     20 bit      12 bit

* We can also glue the frame number and offset back together into the physcial address (Frame # <<12 | offset)

* What else could we do to make this smaller? Compression
  * RLE encoding won't make much of a difference though since we only have a small amount of runs 

* only 1/4 of our pages will be considered "valid"
  * This is because we have 1GB of ram and 4GB of entry space, once again we won't have enough space
  * Some of the entires will be 0s (invalid) and some will be 1s (valid)
    * Some entires are just there and don't hold a valid mapping. this is so we can fill our page table without exceding the space we have
    * This makes our page table **sparse** since we only have 25% of the space being "valid"
    * What do we do about the sparseness? -> just store only the valid page entries
      * How? Use a dense data structure that will hold only our valid entries
      * We could use a linked list but it is slow since traversal is O(N) (same deal with trees but instead is O(logN)
      * Just use a HashMap
