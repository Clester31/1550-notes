## What is an Operating System? (Continued)

* It is a piece of software that:
  * Manages resources
  * Abstracts details
* Is the "adult" in the room  

### Where does an OS get its power?

* The OS is a piece of software that has the power to manage resources and asbtract details
* Basically, the OS can say "no"
  * If you can't say "no" to a request, you don't have any real authority
* The Application is at the top level and the resources are at the bottom level, with the OS in the middle acting as a barrier to resource access from the application

* We hope to establish the OS as an un-bypassable layer between a running application and the resources it wants to use
  * If the OS says no, there should not be another way to go around that
* To ask the OS for something, the running program makes a **system call**

### System Calls  

* Generic framework for what resource requests can look like:

* Because the OS is a piece of software, the problem of the application directly running the needed instructions without asking first is possible
  * Undermines the idea that the OS is an un-bypassable layer
 
### Protection Modes

* Most CPUs partition their instruction sets into at least two different sets
  * **Privileged/kernel mode instructions**
  * **Protected/user mode isntructions**
    * Every instruction/application used by the user is a user mode instruction

* The processor will know what state it is in
* If you try to execute a privileged mode instruction in protected mode, it doesn't work
  * The oppoiste is fine - even the OS uses protected mode instructions
