# Lecture 4

## Unbypassable Layer

* There are some hardware instructions that can only be written in assembly as they differ from OS to OS
* When a protected level program tries to run a privledged level call, it will throw an interrupt and stop the program
* How to know diff between r, i, or j-type instruction
 * An R-Type instruction contains 6 fields: a 6 bit function code (funct), a 5 bit shift amount (shamt), three 5 bit register addresses (rd, rt, rs), and a 6 bit operation code (opcode) which is always zero. (Math stuff)
 * An I-Type instruction contains 4 fields: a 16 bit immediate field (immed. or address), two 5 bit register addresses (rt, rs) and a 6 bit operation code (opcode). (Branch Load Store)
 * A J-Type instruction contains 2 fields: a 26 bit jump destination (target) and a 6 bit operation code (opcode). (JUMP)
