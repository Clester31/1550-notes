## ROHAN"S NOTES - My dumbass slept through class today

* Cooperative vs Comparison
  * Threads are competitive, threads are cooperative
  * We cannot trust programs to voluntarily yield, exit, or block soon enough to allow for the illusion of simultaneous execution
    * Consider the infinite loop: It makes no events (interrupts) by which the OS can regain control
  * We need an event that is not software-originated that we can use to have the OS regain control and make scheduling decisions
    * Add a hardware timer component to o **preemption**   
* We have a process table entries

  * Per entry, there is a process that has not exited
  * We keep that procecss state, priority/scheduling parameters and other info about the process on the table
  * We also have the file descriptor entry in each entry
    * It adds to the security as it aso has the user ID and the group ID
* Fork() is a system call
* A thread is a stream of instructions
  * It makes more sense to have one thread vs however many processes
    * For a process that runs threads, those threads can be found at the same address spacea as the process that it runs under
    * We can also share info between each thread unlike each individual process who can't interact with each other's info without writing the data to a file
    * We could also create a network connection between two processes
  * Multiple processes vs single process with multiple threads

* All blocked processes are denied CPU time but not all blocked processes are blocked because they are in a blocked state in theire lifetime
* There is the thread state, which has its own PC, register, stack pointer, and state

* The stack and heap grow into each other to guarantee the memory is used between them
* There is also the advantage of cooperation in a thread as they work under the same process
* HTTP is stateless
  * It doesn't even know the states of any other process (tabs in a browser, wget, etc.) even from the same client
