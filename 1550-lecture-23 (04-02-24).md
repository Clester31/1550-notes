## Dynamic Allocation

* To support dynamic allocation, we want extra space to grow
* Having this space available but potentially unused means that we may hurt the degree of multiprogramming possible on this systen
* *How do we keep track of what is free and what is in-use?*

### Swapping

* We set up holes in the middle of our region so that we can use it to insert other processes inside of it

### Free Space Tracking - Bitmap

* Free vs in-use are 2 mutually exclusive options, so need 1 bit to track
  * Store 1 bit per "chunk"
    * How big should the chunk be?
      * This could be anytihng, but whatever works for you
      * Magic number: 4KB
        * Small enough so that if we waste it, its not harmful, but also easy to subdivide other chunks
    * We need an additional bit to our 8 bit to store whether our byte is free or not
      * one of every 9th bit (1/9) of our memory is being used to hold our bit
      * In order to make this more efficient, we can increase our chunk size so that it takes up less % of memory
    * Our chunk size is our minimal unit of allocation.
      * If we request a very tiny part of our chunk, we can't use the rest of the chunk, which is wasteful (internal fragmentation)
     
* A new data structure:
  * If we have a sparse graph, use a sparse data structure (linked list, hashmap, tree) in order to only mark the "interesting things"
 
### Free Space Tracking - Linked List

* **Run Length Encoding (RLE)** - Don't write length in unary (base 1) usse another base
* **Sparseness** - If most values are the same, don't store the common value, assume it and store the "interesting" values

### Overlays

* What if available memory is smaller than our total memory needs including room for dynamic allocation?
* It seems like because of the Von Neumann architecture requirements, we're out of luck
* But what is the real requirement:
  * Instructions are fetched from RAM
  * Data accessed by the instructions must be fetched from RAM
* Overlay - Hand written dynamic loading of subset of a program's code and data   

### Virutal Memory

* Overlays are tedious and error prone
* Can we automate the discovery and management of the subsets of program code and data that we need in RAM
* Two Main Issue:
  * How do we handle the relocatino of code and data over time (mapping problem)
  * How do we discover the appropriate subset of our total memory needs to place in RAM (subsetting problem)
* Our attempt to solve this problem will lead to a virtualization of memory
