# Lecture 1

## What is an operating system?

### Definition

* A piece of **software** that manages resources, abstracts details

### Resource Management

* The CPU's time (spent executing instructions)
* The main memory (RAM)
* Input/Output (I/O) Devices
  * Disks (and filesystems)
  * Other hardware peripherals
* Security of the system

### Von Neumann 

* Assuming Von Neumann architecture for the course (or stored program concept)
* Both code and data must be present in a RAM location to do computation
* Von Neumann describes a computer that:
  * Fetches instructions from RAM to execute
  * Those instructions can further modify other RAM locations
    * Those instructions can contain data or even code
   
### Abstraction of Details

* We give the illusion of a system that gives each running program (process):
  * Exclusive access to the CPU's time
  * Huge amounts of dedicated RAM to hold its code and data
  * Exclusive access to I/O devices
  * Transparent security
 
### Virtualize Example: Memory
* In a Von Neumann architecture, if we want to run three programs at the same time, they must all be resident in memory simultaneously
* We can share this source by **partitionaing**
  * Divide the region up into pieces
  * Give a piece to each program

* Partitioning leads to a sharing problem
  * A program can potentially read/write the code or data of another program on the system (protection problem)
  * Programs built for one partition might not work when loaded into a different partition (reolcation problem)
* We don't have these problems when there is just a single program on th ecomputer (exclusive access)
* We can solve this problem by remembering th extents of each partitoin and ensure the program never reads/writes outside it's boundaries

* Our process lives inside an **address space**
  * A "______ space" is a mathematical idea refering to the enumeration of all possible elements of whatever we are talking about
  * It apears to us as programmers and users of the system, that all legal memory addresses are ours
  * This cannot be true for every process
