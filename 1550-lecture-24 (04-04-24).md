# Lecture 24

## Rohan's Notes

* Adding into a table might be O(1) but we strip off the multiplicative contant that is attatched to it
  * As a result it might take too long (size = h * w )
    * Height is # of virtual addresses and Width is the width of the table
   
* We need to memorize the first 10 powers of 2 (2^0 -> 2^9) and then three more (2^10 = kilo, 2^20 = Mega, 2^30 = Giga)
  * Question: If we have 36 bit PA space then it is 2^36 -> 2^6 * 2^30 = 64 GB
 
* The physical address size could not have anything to do with our virtual address space
* We also don't need a table per process
  * Don't make the table size too big or else we might have something ridiculous like 16GB of page per process

* What if we don't want a table? Let's use pages instead
  * A contiguous range of VAs treated as a singular unit for the purpose of translation
 
* We are going to treat a contiguous physical address space as a page frame
* VA space / page = height of page table
* MMU algorithm
  * Input: VA
  * Output: PA
  * Steps:
    * Page # = VA / page size
    * Offset = VA % page size
    * Frame # = PageTable[Page#]
    * PA = frame # * PageSize + Offset
   
* The size of the page and page frame should be the same
* Frame = Pysical address, Page = virtual address
  * We need the memory of the frame and page to map one to one
