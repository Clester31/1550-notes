## Demand Paging

* How do we know a particular page is in a particular frame?
  * When we launch a process, let's give it no RAM? (sounds like it doesn't satisfy VN architecture)
  * Scheduler will pick our process, and set the PC to be the processes entry point (first instruction in the executable)
  * Now we use our table to translate our virtual address to a physical address, we discover that the physical address is invalid
 
* When the MMU translates the virtual address and discovers that the physical page is invalid, the MMU will realize that nothing is actually present in RAM. It will then raise an exception and crash
  * This exception is called a page fault
  * The OS takes over (interrupt)
 
* What does it mean for a virtual address to be good or bad?
  * good = should be in memory (is in bounds), even if it isn't
    * What should be in our address space that is "good" to generate an address in?
      * Stack pointer, .text and .data segments, heap
  * bad = dereferences NULL or address is NULL adjacent. kill the running process
    * Happens when we use something without allocating it 
 
* At the beginning of the executable, we should set the address 0 to always be invalid
  * what if we instead have a pointer to a struct that is null, we will naturally have an offset.
  * Modern OSes will reserve the first few addresses of a process so that we have a place to crash when we dereference NULL
 
* What we really want to happen when we get a good virtual address is to allocate the process a frame to hold the page worth of code or data that the thing that caused the page fault will belong to
* Our page table is *not* RAM, it is a representation of RAM
  * It's like a picture of an object.
 
## Page replacement algorithms (about fucking time)

* If we get a page fault, we are going to guaruntee to give it to a frame whether there is an empty one or not
* Why should the memory subsystem override our scheduler?
  * Every page fault for a good page will end up in RAM
  * any frame that has not been allocated will be emptie
* So which page should we not choose to evict?
  * The page we need next
* What would then be the best possible page to kick out?
  * A page that we will never need again
  * What if we use everything though, what do we kick out now?
    * a page with the lowest page fault rate
    * Whatver is furthest in the future
    * This is the **optimal** page replacement algorithm
   
### Optimal (offline) algorithm

* Evict the page that won't be needed until the furthest in the future
  * Impossible, so use the past to predict the future
  * Look at future lines
    * boot out whatever is not used until far in the future
   
### FIFO algorithm

* First in, first out
* Age of the page is in terms of first entry into RAM
  * Skip over critical frams like the OS and page fault hanlder
 
### NRU (not recently used) -> Where we draw the line

* Evict the page that is the oldest, preferring pages that are not dirty
* Age is in terms of recency of use
* Why is our data page clean if it's not part of our globals
  * We haven't modified or stored it yet
* Kick out someone who's reference and dirty bit is 0
