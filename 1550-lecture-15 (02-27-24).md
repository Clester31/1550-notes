# Lecture 15

## Review

* Scheduling in a non-preemptive batch
* In interactive schedules, we want to interleave execution and preempt so that no event overruns the CPU
* **responsiveness** - how "sanppy" something feels
* **response time** Time from initialition of an action until we see the result of an action

### Interactive Scheduling: Round Robin

* **Quantum** the *maximum* amount of time we will allow a process to run before preempting it
* In a RR scheduler, each process will get the same quantum
* RR does not have any preferences, it will always run in the set order
  * It can still skip a process if it's blocked or not ready

* Only CPU bound processes are likely getting preempted
  * Preemption timer is an alarm, if you wake up before it, you dont need it
    * In the case of the RR scheduler
    * We want our quantum far in the future so that the CPU bursts of our I/O bound processes don't hit the timer at all
  * Any event or interrupt can be used as an opportunity to schedule
* What happens when we have have extra time before a preemption?
  * Do other work. Why waste CPU time? Run another process that is ready
 
#### Pop up window

* When we click on something, and a pop-up window comes up, what delays the box from coming up?
  * After we click, we cause an event that will inevitably run the scheduler,
    * The time taken before the pop up window shows up is:
      * number of jobs * length of quantum (worst case)
      * How can we reduce this time?
        * We can have a smaller quantum
        * Remember, OS is expected to not dictate the work we can do, but to oversee it and keep it moving 
    * Whenever we get scheduling events, we just pick whatever the next ready job on the list is
   
* If we make our quantum as short as possible, what happens?
  * Preemption timer will eventually go off 
  * We will have to do many more context switches, increasing the overhead more than we want
    * We only spend half of the time doing useful work
   
### What do we want?

* We want to increase the ratio of work done to time spent doing work
* If we have a quantum that's 100 times longer, we are only doing context switches for 1% of the time
  * We want to reduce the time we spend doing context switches so we can spend more time doing instructions
* Average quantum is usually in the range of 20 - 100 ms 
   
* Smaller quantum = more jobs get done in a time span, but more time doing non-useful work (context switches)
* Longer quantum = less jobs get done in a time span, but we spend more time doing useful work. Less context switches overall

## Scheduling With Priority (NOTE: this is where we draw the line on midterm material. Nothing new after this)

* Where does priority come from?
  * Priority can be repesented in a range from 1-4
    * 1 is lowest, 4 is highest
  * It all depends on what the user is doing and what applications and processes they seem to be prioritizing

* What do we want priority to mean?
  * More CPU time = longer quantum... right?
    * This would be true in a CPU bound process but it's not exactly the same for I/O bound process
      * We may not be able to block before the preemption timer goes off, which is not what we want
      * In the case of an I/O bound process, we can't really take advantage of the longer quantum. We preempt at the very beginning of the set quantum
        * This will break the illusion of parallelism
     * How do we work around this?
       * Give the process more quantums, just have them be split up
       * In between those splits, run the process with the next highest priority
         * We can place the 2nd highest priority jobs in the same tier as the highest priority jobs so that we run them more
        
* Underlying goal of priority: Give each process, at the very least, their own quantum
  * We can't just run something for a longer singular quantum
 
### Other Scheduling Algorithms

#### Shortest Process Next 
  * SJF applied to Interactive Systems
  * What should a job be?
    * The job is the next burst of CPU time
      * it isn't the entire process, just the time it runs bursts before blocking
    * Use prior behavior as a predictor for future length
    * What do we choose?
      * pick the most I/O bound process that is ready
  * Is this fair?
    * not at times. If there are enough I/O bound processes that are very short, our CPU bound processes may never get picekd
    * We are okay with this, because I/O bound process are valuable, as the time blocked gives more time for the scheduling algorithm to run
   
#### Guaranteed Scheduling
  * N processes get 1/N of the CPU Time
  * How do we implement this?
  * When is this not fair?

#### Fair Share
  * N users get 1/N CPU time

#### Lottery Scheduling
  * Give out tickets, pull one at random, winner runs

### Mechanism vs Policy

* A **mechanism** is the way in which something is done (an algorithm)
* A **policy** is what we want to achieve (parameters to an algoritm)
  * Example: Imagine a computer lab that closes at 8 PM
    * Policy: The computer lab closes at 8 PM
    * Mechanism: Security kicks us out of the lab

# quiz structure
