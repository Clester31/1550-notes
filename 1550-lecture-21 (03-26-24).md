## Producer/Consumer review

* Producer/Consumer - we have a deadlock that results from the race condition
* Issue - The race condition requires us to wake up a process that is still asleep
* Semaphores have a queue of processes
  * We have "up" which increments our counter and adds another wakeup
  * When we wake somebody up, there is a chance that somebody is asleep
  * We might have multiple asleep processes, but we can only choose one to wake up
  * We also have "down" which is a decrement of the coutner and a potential sleep
* Why is this semaphor initialized to 1?
  * We need something to enter the critical region without sleeping
* This allows us to have a enter/leave CR that does not need busy waiting

## Producer/Consumer With Sempahores

* Imagine a computer lab with 5 printers
  * 5 copies of a resource that can be used simultaneously
  * When all of those printers are used, person 6 goes to sleep while waiting
  * When someone is done, we do an up
 
* At the beginning, we have an empty array of n elements
  * Producers will need that empty space, but we can't have more than n of them using the space simultaneously
  * Our semaphor will only update our count if call down
  * What happens when the producer sleeps (does empty.down)
    * We are woken up by the consumer, who will make an empty space after running

* Why did we deadlock when swapping the down calls?
  * We allowed something to sleep in the critical region
* Taking code with a race condition and putting it in a function doesn't eliminate the race condition

* the OS is a third party for the sleeping
  * The OS will never be put to sleep. only the running process
  * Ths OS is not involved in the transaction of sleeping

## Deadlock

* “A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause.”
* Four Conditions for Deadlock

### Four Conditions for Deadlock

* Mutual Exclusion
  * Resource can only be held by one process at a time
* Hold and wait
  * Process gains one resource, holds it, then attempts to gain anohter, waiting if failed
* No preemption
  * Resource cannot be forcibly taken away
* Circular wait
  * Process A is waiting for a resource held by process B which is waiting for a resource held by Process A...
