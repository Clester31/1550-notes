# Lecture 19

## Race conditions

* We have two threads that are sharing the same shared (global) states
* Race conditions are about which process can finish their work first, which ends up being the work that gets reflected in our results
  * Even if process A is set up correctly, B could sneak in, change the value of the tail, and our state is incorrect

* How do we determine when we enter a critical region?
  * Write some more code to say when we enter and leave a critical region
  * We need some shared global state (flag) to mark if it is safe or not to enter the critical region
 
* We could disable interrupts, but that's a stupid idea

* If we have Process A that enters it's critical region, B can still do non-critical work, but the moment it enters it's critical region, it get's blocked

* Goals for synchronization
  * It should work
  * It should work on any system
  * No need to worry about the race condition outside the critical region
  * No one should have to wait forever
 
### Strict Alternation and Busy Waiting

* Process A starts:
  * Enter the critical region
  * Our turn does not equal 0, so we do not enter the loop
  * So we leave, and go into process B
  * Since turn does not equal 1, we go through the loop and wait until we get preempted
  * Then we move back to A, leave the critical region
  * Now we leave our loop since turn is now 1
 
* Issue, we would rather spend our time doing actual work rather than usless work that's only goal is to pass the time
* However, it does accomplish what we set out to do: prevent race conditions. It's just inefficient
  * But we could have a case where we interrupt right before we change turn back, meaning that we switch inside the critical region
  * What if we have process C now?
* We must strictly alternate, we cannot run the same process twice in a row

### Hardware Support

* If CPU has special instructions to support locking atomically, we could make this implementation work:

#### Peterson's Solution

* We no longer have a locked variable. It is instead replaced with an array
