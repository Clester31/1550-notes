# Lecture 8

## CPU Time

* The first resource we are looking to manage its time spent running instructions on te CPU on behalf of the running program
* A running program and its associated data is called a **process**
* A program is the code and (static) data typically stored in an executable file on disk
  * The VN architecture prevents us from running it until it has been copied into ram
 
* We can Load processes into memory and the OS can choose to run these instructions
  * Multiple instances can be created of this process (i.e. opening multiple tabs on a web browser)
 
## Multiprogramming

* **Multiprogramming** (Multiprocessing/tasking) is the ability to run multiple processes at the same time
* This problem is easy if we have N processes and N processors (CPUs)
* If we have more processes than processors, then the CPU will be responsible for more than one process (pigeonhole principle)
  * We will have the share the CPU's time

* Take that work, slice it into pieces, and try to switch between those pieces fast enough until the user does not notice the changes in processes
  * If we only have one program couter, this is how we run all the processes we need to
 
### Process Life Cycle

* We have everything needed to rune except the CPU's time
* How did we pick from all the processes we have running? - **Scheduling**
* When we chhose a ready process and give it its time, we cannot be running code from the OS
* When our program terminates normally, it makes a syscall called **exit**
  * This is a normal **terminatoin**; when we exit when we intend to
    * main() has a caller which will exit based on the return variable it gets
   
* **Batch System** - starts a process -> completes it -> runs a process to replace it
  * Do this until we have completed all our work
 
* When you want data to get copied in RAM from a source (internet, hard disk, user input) - You need to use the **read()** syscall
  * The data we want does not satisfy the VN architecure that our data is in RAM. It comes from another source (inernet, hard disk, user)
  * What does our program do while waiting for something to put in memory? Block it (wait for input to be in RAM)   

* When can our pogram being exectuion again? When we finally have the data in RAM that we are requesting
* When the data transfer is complete, we need to change the state of the process from block to ready
  * We should also run the scheduler to move on to other processes
    * **Scheduling = choosing amongst ready processes**
  * You cannot schedule a process that is blocked, as it has no work is needs to do
  * When you unblock, you are ready, and the scheduler will choose what to do next
    * We need an event to tell the OS when to run and instructions on what to do (i.e. an interrupt)
   
### I/O via Interrupts

* Hardware exchanges information over a shared communications network called the **bus**
* Each device listens for addresses/commands it is responsible for handling and does the request
* The message that the CPU must handle are delivered as **hardware interrupts**, which behave much as software ones do

* Between a block and a ready, run another task that is ready
