# Lecture 5

## Review

* We have two modes, privleged and protected
  * When we try to run a plivledged command in protected mode, the program will throw an exception and stop 
* The OS is not constantly running. We might simplify a system down to a 1 CPU system
  * The OS cannot just watch what our software is doing
* If the OS is not constantly watching the system, how do we know that a plivledged command is being executed in protected mode?
  * At the CPU level, we fetch an instruction
  * We decode it and look at the opcode and see what mode our instruction is in
  * And then we raise an exception/interrupt, the OS startrs running
  * Then the OS sends the process a signal which terminates it
* In the byte code, there is a table in the class file that has the range of the try block
  * If it finds an exception in that range, it runs that function to handle that exception
 
### System Calls

* How do we change the mode from protected to privledged?
  * We need some way of switching modes, i.e., **system calls**. Now we are in privledged mode
  * Now we also need a system return that changes back to user mode.
  * Jump and link preserves the mode, there is no switch involved (printf() will make the write() call)
* Now, what do we set the program coutner to?
  * jump and link is a J-type instruction, we set the immediate and shift it, and now we can jump anywhere
    * Syscall is actually an R-type instruction
    ```Assembly
    ; JAL printf
      $ra = pc + 4;
      $pc = label
    ; SYSCALL
      mode = private;
      $pc = interrupt vector[interrupt type]
    ```
* The interrupt vector contains the table that indexes our interrupts/exceptions

### Hardware vs Software interrupts

* IF we want the OS to do work, we need events to stop what we're doing and switch the the OS
* The processor first looks at what kind of interrupt happen, and uses that to index the interrupt vector (indexed by interrupt type)
  * All syscalls are the same type of interrupt
  * SYSCALL = INT 0x80
  * So the syscall table is essentially indexed by [$v0}
* Interrupt vector is a hardware table and is in the state of the CUP. The Syscall table is not, and is just an array in RAM.
* Over 300! system calls in Linux. About 128 interrupts

### The process of running syscalls, and all that fun stuff

* First step: look in IV for interrupt (basically a mapping between event and event handler)
* Next: the OS starts running, and then we grab v0, index the syscall table, and go the function we want to
* The syscall handler then jumps back to the right address
* Whatever code handles the system events is, by definition, the Operating System
  * Only the OS can set the interrupt vector (a privvledged task)
  * To be the OS, we have to do privledged work, which must make us the OS (bootstrapping problem)
 
* When you turn the power on, the processor must start in privledged mode
  * Thus, the first thing that runs is the Operating System
