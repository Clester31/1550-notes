# Lecture 7

## Scheduiling... finally

* Space - the enumeration of all possible things
* Design space - The enumeration of all possible designs
  * i.e. how to architect the design of the OS
* The scheduler knows what we have to do, when we need to do, and how we make time for it
* After making a choice, the OS will set its state so that it will run our process
  
 
### OS Software design

* The Monolithic Kernel
  * Mono = one; Lithos = rock
  * All three tasks (Main procedure, service routines, Utility routines) are found in the kernel
    * We then choose the job from the linked list
    * Then we set up the CPU state to switch the task
    * Set PC to be set to the process we want
  * Every part of a task lives within the kernel's address space
  * Work must be loaded into RAM as well as the data we are working with (von neumann)
  * All of the work in the monolithic kernel must be bundled into the OS
  * Better for performance
 
* The Microkernel/Exokernel
  * simply: have the OS do less/not do some things the monolithic kernel would do
    * Things are pushed outside into user-space process
  * the microkernel consists more of the privledged instructions that do most of the work we expect the OS to do
  * Client Server -> Memory Server -> Client Process
  * App is located in the process server
  * The work will usually be more expensive due to additional context switches
  * Smaller code will help with compile times and security.
  * Why would we want to change out a system beside modifying its algorithm?
    * If we don't handle an error properly, the kernel (and the system for that matter) crashes
   
* Linux = monolithic
* Windows = macrokernel 
 
### Virtual Machines

* Types
  1. Application Level
  2. Process Level
  3. Hypervisor/VMM
 
* Virtual machiens manage resources and abstract details by virutalizing an entire system rather than each individual resource

## Scheduling ...for real this time

### CPU Time
* First resouce we are looking to manage is the time spent running instructions on the CPU on behalf of a running progrma
* A running program and its associated data is called a **Process**
* A program is the code and static data typically stored in an executable file on disk
  * The Von Neumann architecture prevents us from running it until it has been copied into RAM
  * Consider the program the template for execution (akin to a class in an OOP language)
  * Each instance is then a process
