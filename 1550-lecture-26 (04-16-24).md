# Lecture 26

## Review

* 2 Components to virtual memory
  * Provide an address space
  * Build program believing we have exclusive access to that memory region
  * Protection problem (where we think the location is isn't where it truly is)
 
* We want a mapping between virtual and physical pages
  * Whatever scheme we used must avoid collisions unless we absolutely need to (no hashing)
 
* We aslo want our mapping structure to be small and fast (located in the chip)

### Mapping

* Use a table, indexed by the virtual address to map virtual to physical addresses
* Size of the table could be too large if we had one entry per virtual address
* Reduce number of entries by "chunking" our virtual address space into fixed size chunks known as pages

* We can't use sentienl values as bad values cannot exist in the same area as the good values (like -1)
  * Instead, have an extra bit per entry (0 or 1) that says wheter our mapping exists or not
 
* We should have a relatively sparse table?
  * How do we take advantage of this sparseness? Linked lists
    * Have a list that maintains only the valid entries
    * This is problematic as our search through the list will be O(N), which ruins our O(1) benchmark
  * How about trees?
    * Depth is still an issue, and is our worst case runtime
    * How about we instead have a tree that has a fixed depth instead
      * Our leafs will be our page table entires 
      * Our leaf will store data and the root will hold pointers to all the leaves
      * Our leaves will have no children
      * r * l = # of pages
    * How does a tree help to save space over a table?
      * We omit leaves that we do not need
    * Why should we take free space that hold  
 
* Protection bit contains our instruction (r, w, x)
  * Just like in mmap()
  * Helps to metigate security exploits like buffer overflow (or overrun?)
 
### Multilevel Page Tables

* We have a root that is always present, that points to leaves. Leaves contain multiple Page Table Entries (PTEs) that store the page to frame mapping.
* This is sparse because if a leafâ€™s worth of PTEs are invalid, that leaf can be omitted.

### Inverted Page Tables

* There are vastly more pages (across all processes) than there are frames in a typical system
   Build a table indexed by the frame number that tells us what is in that frame

### Cache

* Caches are small memories that can be used to speed up common operations
  * Replace expensive operation with quick table lookup
 
* Caches exploit locality
  * Temporary locality - nearness in time (use the same value again and again)
  * Spatial locallity - Nearness in location (use a value, use a neighboor soon)
 
## Subsetting

### Demand Process

* How to establish page to frame mapping
* If we gave our newly launched process no frames, we wouldn't be able to run the process since our instructions haven't been fetched and put into RAM
* Before we schedule a process to run, we have to set the #PC

* When we launch a process, give that process no RAM
* Make a page table where all entires are deemed to be invalid (the space for the PTE exists but does not represent an actual page to frame mapping)

### Page Fault Handler

* If requested oage is "bad" (not in the code or data segments or beyond brk and sp)
  * SEGFAULT on error - likely terminate the running process
 
* When the page is "good" (this is a page that should be a RAM but isn't)
  * Find an empty frame
    * If physical memory is full, choose a frame to evict
    * If evicted is dirty, write frame to disk
