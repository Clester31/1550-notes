## Review

* Batch System
  * Takes a system and runs it to completion. Starts another process right after that
  * Run to completion
 
### Batch Schedulling - First Come First Serve
 
* Shceduling Algorithm
  * Simply take the jobs in arrival order (first come first serve)
  * Quantitative measures
    * Throughput: the number of jobs over the total time
      * Throughput is a fractional value (quarter of a job per unit of time)
    * Average turnaround time: get our turnaround times and average them by the number of tasks
    * Turnaround time (time job finished - time job arrived)

  * Complete Throughput: #jobs/time = 4/16 = **1/4**
  * Average Turnaround Time: 4 + 7 + 13 + 16  4 = 40/4 = **10**
    * finish - arrival
    * 4 - 0 = 4
    * 7 - 0 = 7
    * 13 - 0 = 13
    * 16 - 0 = 16
   
  * If we have a queue in arrival order, we just simply remove the head (O(1) operation)
  * Overall, our runtime for the FCFS is **O(N)**
  * Fairness: FCFS seems reasonably fair, the first in line get the resource first
  * Since finish time is determined by execution time and the time we spent waiting
    * A way to get a better average turnaround time, is to run the shortest job first
   
### Batch Scheduling - Shortest Job First

* How do we pick the shortest job first?
* Throughput: 4 jobs / 16 time units = **1/4**
* Average Turnaround time: **35/4**
  * A: 10 - 0 = 10
  * B: 3 - 0 = 3
  * C: 16 - 0 = 16
  * D: 6 - 0 = 6
* Proof by exchange: This algorithm is optimal and gives you the shortest turnaround time
* Asymptotic Analysis:
  * When a job arrives, we have a list of jobs that are ordered by execution length: O(n)
  * Amount of work we have to do for shortest job to schedule: O(1)
  * Overall runtime: O(n^2)
  * What we want: O(N lg N)
    * How can we do that? HeapSort (Tree)
    * Insert: lg n
    * Remove: constant
  * Comperable: most likely not - prone to starvation as longer jobs will stay in the back if shorter jobs keep coming on
    * Also provably impossible (somehow? - halting problem; how can we determine the runtime of a job?)
  * A slightly faster average turnaround time isn't worth it for a slower and impossible algorithm
 
### Interactive Scheduling Metrics

* Responsiveness - how "snappy" things feel
  * This is qualitative, how do we qualify it?
 
* Response time - Time from initiation of an action until we see the results of an action
