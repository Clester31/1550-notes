# Lecture 6

## Review

* Processor helps us by knowing what mode we are in, making sure the appropriate partition of instructions are being executed
* How do we know that the OS is able to do work?
  * The OS is there, but it is usually off doing something else. When we need to get its attention, we call for its help
  * The OS is event driven, the two are system calls and interrupts
* What are the differences betwen JAL and a System Call?
  * JAL does not switch modes
  * System Call changes mode from protected and lets the OS know that we are changing modes to run kernel code
  * System return finished the call and brings the user back to protected mode.
* When doing a syscall, we place an ordinal number into $v0, which is used to index the interrupt vector to get our syscall
  * We can't just use an address for the syscall as it is not in the address space of our program
    * The address space at address 2000 in our running program is different from the address 2000 in the kernel space
   
## More system call stuff

* Why don't we want the address of the system call embeded in the instruction stream?
  * You can't change that address, and if it somehow moves, anything that knew where the system call originally was, will now no longer have it
    * Interrupt vector is part of the CPU, so we can have immediate access to it (and also why its so small)
* How do we get to the system call we want to run?
  * The syscall table is in RAM, we go to that if the interrupt we indexed (by $v0) is a syscall
 
* A single syscall isntruction is a little more expensive than a division (~50 ms)
  * Slow by processor standards but not all that slow

* Registers help to avoid always searching through RAM.
  * We can access those values at the same rate we can do math on them
  * When we need to be able to retrieve data at the rate the CPU wants
    * Registers are shared
   
## Context Switch

* The instructions of the OS use the same hardware resources (general purpose registers)
  * We have to put things back the way they were when we return from the OS
  * This save/restore of shared state is known as a **context switch**
* On entry to the OS, save all shared state and restore OS state. On return from the OS, do the inverse
* Where is it safe to store these values? -> Memory
* Our measure of time: Reduce the number of context switches to improve system performance
* A context switch will take a considerable amount of time to perform (100s of seconds per sw, and we may have dozens)
