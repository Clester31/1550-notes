# Lecture 12

## Review

* Two diometrically oppposed ways of doing something
* Two different ways that an OS handles threads
  * Kernel Threads
    * OS has complete knowledge over all threads on the system and what they want to execute
    * If we have a long running computation in kernel threading, we would have a preemption
    * When we have a blocking call in kernel threading, we mark that thread as blocked
      * We then run the scheduler which will choose between any thread/process that is ready 
  * User Threads
    * Threads are not the users problem, a library maintains and manages the threads
    * If we have a long running computation in user threading, the CPU's time will be used by that process, leading to starvation
      * Fix: Use a yield() call so that we can run the scheduler again 
    * When we have a blocking call in user threading, the entire process is blocked,
      * Our other threads will only run until that thread is unblocked
  * Performance argument:
    * User threads are faster as we do less context switches into the Kernel
      * pthread_create could just be implemented as a function call
     
* If there are other threads to run, rather than looping, just yield
  * scanf() will move into the threading library, where it will not return from the left-most thread, so that we can do work in other threads
  * select() is a non-blocking system call that tells us weather reading the data would block or not
    * Call select() a second time when we want to check when the data is available for the left most thread

* When to Schedule
  * Choosing which of the ready processes is next
  * What event tells the kernel when to schedule?
    * A processis created
      * Now there is one more ready process to run
    * A process exits
      * The running process is done, so pick a ready replacement
    * A process blocks
      * The running process can no longer execute coe until the requested data becomes available, pick something ready
    * A HW IO interrupt
      * Data from a blocked process is now available, consider running something else
    * Clock Interrupts
      * The preemption timer warns us that the running process has used alot of CPU time. Maybe we should pick something else
     
* Wall Clock time

  * How long it seems that a program takes the execute
  * The blue and purple processes take the same amount of time (1 unit)
 
* Value of IO Bound Processes
  * Multiple IO bound processes can be scheduled at the same time without increasing the amount of time necessary to run them
  * IO bound proecsses are common
    * Interactive programs have a lot of IO
    * Moore's law / Amadhi's law
